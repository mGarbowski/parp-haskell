As you slowly open your eyes, a throbbing ache reverberates through your head,
and the acrid scent of chemicals fills the air. Disoriented, you find yourself lying
on a cold metal floor in what appears to be a dimly lit locker room. The flickering
light above casts unsettling shadows on the lockers that surround you.

A soft hum of emergency alarms pulsates through the room, and the distant echoes
of chaotic commotion resonate in the air. Struggling to your feet, you notice a faint
glow emanating from a small screen hanged on the wall near the entrance.
The screen flickers to life, displaying a message in stark white letters:

"Dr S., the experiment has failed. Containment breach detected. Evacuation
protocol initiated. Escape the facility before critical systems fail. Beware of
anomalies. Your survival is paramount. Time is of the essence."

With a sense of urgency, you realize that your fate is entwined with the impending
collapse of the lab. The clock is ticking, and the path to freedom is uncertain.

The locker room is dimly lit, with a faint hum of machinery in the air. Rows
of lockers fill the space, closed and orderly. However, one locker catches
your eye - slightly open, a hint of something inside. It seems like the owner
forgot to lock it properly
To the north, a heavy metal door labeled "Security" and a modern keypad next to it present themselves to you
To the east, you see another door with no labels as to where it leads

Enter your command:
> inspect locker

A locker for storing personal items
The locker reveals two compartments, in the upper part, a lab coat hangs neatly on a hanger
Below there is another compartment.
> inspect coat

The lab coat stirs a sense of familiarity.
The nametag reads: "Dr. J. Sysy.", it triggers a cascade of hazy memories. As you run your
fingers over the fabric, flashes of experiments and research echo in your mind.
Memories start coming back to you, it is your coat!
Instinctively you check your pockets. You feel a small, cold object - a key
> inventory

- locker room key x1
> inspect compartment

The bottom compartment is locked. There is a keyhole, but where is the key?
> unlock east

Door unlocked
> go east

You find yourself in a dimly lit corridor, the ambient light casting faint shadows.
Directly ahead to the north, a door labeled "Generator Room" stands prominently.
Looking to the south, the corridor stretches away, its destination obscured by the dim lighting,
The western door leads to the locker room.

> go south

You are further down the corridor, to the west - entrance to the experiment chamber.
The air is heavy with the weight of past scientific endeavors ...or are those toxic fumes?
To the east - a locked door guards more secrets.

> go west

You are in the experiment room. The floor is covered in a sticky, toxic sludge.
On the other side of the room, you see a small metal tool chest.
If you were only able to go through the sludge,
you could see what's inside. The door was blown open by the failure of the experiment, it seems.
The broken door is laying next to where you stand.
> hint here

You need to acquire some protective gear to walk through the toxic sludge.
Objects in the room: broken door
> inspect broken door

A massive door, ripped out of its hinges is laying on the floor next to the entrance it used to guard.
You inspect the door closely and decide to flip it over.
What a surprise! Somebody must've put a key into the keyhole.
The key is bent, but it is attached to a keychain, on which there is another key.
What could it unlock?

Directly ahead to the north, a door labeled "Generator Room" stands prominently.
Looking to the south, the corridor stretches away, its destination obscured by the dim lighting,
The western door leads to the locker room.

> go north

As you explore the generator room, the dormant generator at the center stands in
stark contrast to the adjacent ventilation shaft. The idle turbines offer a
glimpse into the halted functionality of the lab's power source.
The ventilation shaft on the southern wall,
though vibrating with a faint breeze, seems large enough for someone to
fit through.
> inspect generator

The emergency power generator looms with a single glowing cell within, flanked by two conspicuous empty slots,
rendering the machine silent and incomplete, waiting for its missing components.
In order to restore electricity in the lab, the two remaining cells have to be found.
> unlock vent

You slide the crowbar between the vent door and its door frame
and push with a lot of force. The vent swings open!
> enter vent

You are in the vent shaft. You can proceed east, south or north
> go east

As you're crawling out of the ventilation shaft, you notice an elevator.
Finally, a way out of this maze!
> hint here

You can interact with vent and elevator
Objects in the room: power cell, elevator, vent
> take power cell

> hint elevator

To go inside use `enter elevator`
> enter elevator

You enter the elevator, but it is not responsive to you pressing the buttons, the security
override is in effect.
> enter vent

You are in the vent shaft. You can proceed east, south or north
> go south

As you step into the room bathed in soft light, you notice a solitary desk at
its center. On the desk rests a computer, its screen silent and
dark. The absence of the usual hum of electronic activity adds an eerie calm
to the room, leaving the space seemingly dormant.
To the west there is a door locked from this side.

> inspect desk

The desk in the room is simple yet functional. It holds a powered-off computer
at its center. The smooth surface suggests a place for work or study, while
the surrounding space remains uncluttered, you bend to see what's underneath it
There is a sticky note! It says "pass: rot13(XvetvfJnygre)"
What's rot13? The computer nerds from the lab wouldn't just leave a password in plain text for everyone to see

> power on generator

With a satisfying click, you slot the power cells into place.
The generator springs to life with a reassuring hum. Lights flicker on, flooding the room with a steady glow.
The air vibrates with renewed energy, and the machinery's gentle rumble signals success, powering up the entire lab.

Only 6 digits? That's only like 999 999 options, you can just brute force it...
...or look around for the code, it must be *somewhere*

The security room is dimly lit, the soft glow of monitors casting a blue hue on
the walls. The air is cool, and the hum of electronic equipment fills the room.
Rows of monitors display surveillance footage, capturing glimpses of different
sections of the lab. The power control switches on the central console beckon,
suggesting a pivotal role in the functionality of the facility.

of accomplishment washes over you. The familiar hum of the machinery gradually
fades as you reach the surface, greeted by natural light and the open air. The
door opens, revealing a world beyond the confines of the secretive lab. You have
successfully escaped, leaving the mysteries and experiments behind. What lies
ahead is a new chapter, and the journey to freedom is now yours to explore.

The game is over. Thanks for playing!
